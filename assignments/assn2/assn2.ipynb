    "\n",
    "Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should start early so that you have time to get help if you're stuck. The drop-in office hours schedule can be found on Canvas. You can also post questions or start discussions on Ed Discussion. The assignment may look long at first glance, but the problems are broken up into steps that should help you to make steady progress.\n",

    "**Submission**\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your assignment as a pdf file on Gradescope, and as a notebook (.ipynb) on Canvas. You can access Gradescope through Canvas on the left-side of the class home page. The problems in each homework assignment are numbered. Note: When submitting on Gradescope, please select the correct pages of your pdf that correspond to each problem. This will allow graders to more easily find your complete solution to each problem.\n",
